<p>Let’s start out this blog series with something simple. When teaching other developers about JavaScript, I’ve found that one of the strangest things for them is asynchronous functions. But, so many modern frameworks use them, that it's almost impossible to touch JavaScript without using async functions, so let's get into it:</p>

<h1>How they're done</h1>

<p>Looking at someone else’s code with async might be confusing, so let's strip it down to its base:</p>

<p>This makes sense, right?</p>

<p>Yeah, that's easy. We’re just making a function that adds two things together. Now here's how it looks as an asynchronous function:</p>

<p>So what's happening? Instead of using a "return" statement, we're using a <strong>callback function</strong>. A callback function is passed in as a parameter to your asynchronous function. Once your async function is done with all of its work, it executes the callback function and passes anything that needs to be returned into its parameter.</p>

<h1>Why They’re Done</h1>

<p>We've seen that async functions are pretty easy, but why are they done other than for the purpose of making your code really ugly when you have a line of async functions?</p>

<p>(There are solutions for this in JavaScript libraries like “async," but we’re not going to go into that here.</p>

<p>Often times, more complex operations are required than simply adding two numbers together, and often times these complex operations take time and would hold up the system if we were to simply wait for them to complete. Database reads/writes, http requests, and timeouts are just a few examples.</p>

<p>Here's a sample using JavaScript's setTimeout function which takes it two parameters (a callback function and the amount of wait time in milliseconds):</p>

<p>If you were to run this code in your browser, your browser's console would print</p>

<p>
-> Who will wait for me?<br />
-> I'm too busy to wait for you.
</p>

<p>Then after 1 second:</p>

<p>
-> I waited for you
</p>

<p>This is because the program continues to run even while waiting for the timeout. It would be pretty horrible if anything requiring a wait time stopped the entire program upon execution. Other languages have their own methods of handling wait times, but asynchronous functions solve this problem for JavaScript.</p>
